by Firstname Lastname, Another Person, Third Person

# Status

Early Draft

# Abstract

??? abstract, preferably shorter than 200 words. Please outline the
need for, and design of, the proposal.

# Issues

??? Optional section that may point out things to be resolved. This
will not appear in the final SRFI.

# Rationale

??? detailed rationale. This should be 200-500 words long. Please
explain why the proposal should be incorporated as a standard feature
in Scheme implementations. List related standards and SRFIs, including
dependencies, conflicts, and replacements. If there are other
standards which this proposal will replace or with which it will
compete, please explain why the present proposal is a substantial
improvement.

## Survey of prior art

GitHub's version of Markdown can make tables. For example:

| System        | Procedure | Signature                 |
| ------------- |:---------:| ------------------------- |
| System A      | `jumble`  | _list_ _elem_             |
| System B      | `bungle`  | _elem_ _list_             |
| System C      | `frob`    | _list_ _elem_ _predicate_ |

# Specification

## Package metadata

```
(package

  (version <string>)
  (author <name> <email>)       ; allow multiple
  (maintainer <name> <email>)   ; allow multiple
  (license <license-expression>)
  (homepage <uri>)
  (manual <uri>)                ; can be a relative filename in snow-fort
  (category <category>)         ; allow multiple
  (synopsis <string>)
  (long-description <string>)

  (depends ...)
  (test-depends ...)
  (test-script <filename>))

## License expression sublanguage

License information is given in a [domain-specific language for SPDX license expressions](https://gitlab.com/weinholt/spdx).

 - (**or** *expr0* *expr1*) — A choice between license expressions.
 - (**and** *expr0* *expr1*) — A requirement to comply with both
   license expressions.
 - (**with** *license* *exception*) — A license identifier with a
   license exception identifier (both strings).
 - (**user-defined** *document-ref* *license-ref*) — This is a
   user-defined license reference. The document is optional and `#f`
   if omitted, otherwise both are strings.
 - (**+** *license-identifier*) — Represents "(or later)". Example:
   `(+ "GPL-3.0")` represents "GNU GPL version 3 (or later)".
 - *license-identifier* — A string identifying a license. Example:
   `"GPL-3.0"`.

Allowed characters in strings are A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and hyphen (-). No
check is done to verify that license identifiers and license exception
identifiers are valid.
